"""LLM-as-judge dispatch for benchmark answer grading.

Each family lives in its own module under ``benchmarks/judges/``:
    - hle.py            → verify_hle (also covers superchem_text)
    - browsecomp.py     → verify_browsecomp, verify_browsecomp_zh
    - frontier_science.py → verify_frontier_science(_olympiad), score_frontier_science
    - deepsearchqa.py   → verify_deepsearchqa
    - xbench.py         → verify_xbench
    - widesearch.py     → score_widesearch (returns (verdict, f1_by_item))

Shared infra (LLM client, retry helpers, types) is in _common.py.

Endpoint comes from ``JUDGE_API_KEY`` / ``JUDGE_BASE_URL`` env (with
``OPENAI_*`` fallback). The judge model and reasoning effort are pinned
per benchmark inside each family module — not configurable via env.

Adding a new benchmark's judge:
    1. Create benchmarks/judges/<family>.py implementing
       ``async def verify_<name>(question, target, predicted) -> Verdict``.
    2. Register it in JUDGE_REGISTRY below.
