# Transferable Engineering Principles for Autonomous Research OS

This document outlines the core engineering principles extracted from state-of-the-art research and synthesized inside the evolved `AgentHarness` framework.

## Principle 1: Hexagonal Isolation of Strategic Planning
- **Concept**: Never pollute the strategic planning history with task execution outputs.
- **Implementation**: The `StrategicPlanner` compiles a frozen `Roadmap`, while the `TaskExecutor` processes individual steps. Output payloads are validated by a `PlanVerifier` and kept strictly isolated from the planner's memory.

## Principle 2: Multi-Tier Memory Consolidation
- **Concept**: Distinguish short-term context window history from persistent semantic memory.
- **Implementation**: Short-term history is compacted via sliding windows, while structured evidence cards, facts, and beliefs are persisted inside a SQLite semantic memory repository. High-confidence facts are promoted, and low-confidence ones are pruned to satisfy token budgets.

## Principle 3: Model-Collapse Guard via Quality Downsampling
- **Concept**: Automatically prevent self-generated SFT training datasets from causing recursive model degradation.
- **Implementation**: The `TrajectoryDatasetCompiler` tracks the ratio of self-generated vs. real trajectory traces. In strict mode, it raises errors on threshold breach; in relaxed mode, it downsamples self-generated data, keeping only high-scoring traces.

## Principle 4: Two-Level Credit Assignment
- **Concept**: Calculate both global trajectory success and progressive step-level contribution.
- **Implementation**: The `TwoLevelCreditAssignment` engine applies positive reinforcement ($1.0 \times \frac{i}{N}$) for successful steps, and progressive penalties ($-0.2 \times \frac{i}{N}$) for steps leading to failure.
